1. Focusing on Negative Goals ? eg: dont get poor, dont get sugar.
2. Taking Too big a Goal ? eg. dont take too many things to-gether. Take the next immediate goal, if you take too manythings, it will be too much for mind

Loop - Fear, Desperation, insecurity, Lack of Confidence will also come with Goals.
Because of this Negative feelings it stops you from reaching your goals.

eg: I will become CEO, but i will become in this company. this is dependent.
I will marry this person only, you should be saying good person, not this person.
I want property is okay, but someone should die for me to get property.
Getting a job in SF is dependent goal, You should get high paying Job is indepedent goal.

`Can i Let it go`
`Can i let it be`
`wait karo - 1 mins`

##Step:3   

Happy Hat / - do your Happy Hat giving gratitude that it has already happened. 

`Celebrate and tell Thank you! Thank You! Thank You!` - kises se jalna nahi hai celebrate karna hai.
